# Simon-Says-Game
Welcome to the Simon Says Game! ðŸŽ®

This project is a fun and interactive implementation of the classic memory game, Simon Says. The game tests your memory and concentration as you try to follow a sequence of colors and sounds. With each round, the sequence becomes more challenging, and you must repeat it correctly to advance.

Technologies Used:
HTML5: For structuring the game interface.
CSS3: For styling and making the game visually appealing.
JavaScript: For handling the game logic, including sequence generation and user interaction.
